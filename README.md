# Japanese Interactive Keyboard

This keyboard was designed to help you easily learn Japanese hiragana and katakana.
Combined with a language platform like Duolingo, you can discover and learn Japanese symbols.

Several options are available to enhance your learning and encourage your memory to retain the symbols rather than just the sounds:

    - Generate symbols randomly
    - Disable the sound display when selecting a symbol

You can enable console messages to help you navigate the code more easily.
